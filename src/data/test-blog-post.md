Puppeteer is a powerful Node.js library that provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium browsers. It's widely used for web scraping, automated testing, and even automating repetitive tasks such as filling out online forms. In this article, we'll explore how to use Puppeteer to automate form filling on websites.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Next, initialize a new Node.js project and install Puppeteer:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install puppeteer

```

## Automating Form Filling

### Setting up Puppeteer

To begin automating form filling, create a JavaScript file (e.g., `form-fill.js`) and import Puppeteer:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
```

## Navigating to a Website

Specify the URL of the website you want to automate form filling on:

```javascript
(async () => {
	const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
	const page = await browser.newPage();
})();
```
